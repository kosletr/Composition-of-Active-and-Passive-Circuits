# Composition-of-Active-and-Passive-Circuits

### Description
This collection of scripts was created for the scope of an assignment in a Composition-of-Active-and-Passive-Circuits cource of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the 2018-19 academic year. The main purpose of these projects is to demonstrate the implementation of a series of different active circuits - analog filters, satisifying a set of specifications. For this purpose important intel such as FFT Analysis, Transient Analysis, Bode Diagrams etc. is provided.

### Implementations - Specifications

#### Low Pass Filter - Inverse Chebyshev
 - f_p  = 5.5 KHz
 - f_s = 10.45 KHz
 - a_max = 0.3 dB
 - a_min = 25 dB

#### Band Pass Filter - Inverse Chebyshev
 - f_p  = 5.5 KHz
 - f_s = 10.45 KHz
 - a_max = 0.3 dB
 - a_min = 25 dB

### Setup
The provided code was created using MATLAB R2019a, however older MATLAB versions should work fine. All of the .m scripts provided, are  commented for higher readability and maintenance.
